# FTCControl
A program for FTC

This will be the program for the CA FTC 2016 Robot.

To develop the program it is recommended to have the following software:
Android Studio : Required to program, it sets up everything you need, except maybe java, and the JDK. https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

JDK: Needed to compile java code (probably) http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Git for Windows : Easy way to connect to github. Allows for the Android Studio/github integration. 
**** IF you are installing Git for windows remember to set it to the path in the installation options 
or else android studio cannot find it. ****

FTC Software: Needed to use the motors and other robotics features of the robot.

TODO:

Get some basic code running a motor or something.

Get joystick control.
